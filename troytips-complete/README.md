# Troy Tips

TroyTips is a project made for HackSC's Hack Nights. I'll be using this project
to teach students the basic of full stack web development.

The idea is that this application will let users submit USC campus related tips
to a shared feed.

Hopefully, attendees will learn basic HTML/CSS, GET/POST requests, and
Node.js + MongoDB basics.

## How to Run

* Make sure you have an instance of MongoDB running
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm start`
* Access `localhost:3000` in your browser
